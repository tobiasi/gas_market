# Gas Market Data Processing - Progress Summary

## Current Status: PAUSED - Ready to Resume

### ‚úÖ Completed Tasks
1. **Target Analysis Complete** - Successfully analyzed the "Daily historic data by category" tab structure
2. **Raw Data Located** - Found and pulled `bloomberg_raw_data.csv` from GitHub (3241 rows, 430 columns)
3. **Basic Processing Script Created** - Built `process_raw_data_to_target.py` that loads and normalizes data
4. **Target Values Identified** - We know exactly what values we need to match:
   - Italy: 151.47 (we got 117.43 - close but need refinement)
   - Total: 767.69 (we got 603.69 - missing ~164)
   - Industrial: 268.26 (we got 356.53 - too high)
   - LDZ: 325.29 (we got 4119.60 - way too high, wrong aggregation)
   - Gas-to-Power: 174.14 (we got 442.71 - too high)

### üîÑ Next Steps When Resuming
1. **Run detailed target analysis** - Execute `analyze_target_structure_detailed.py` to understand exact column mapping
2. **Fix aggregation logic** - The current aggregation is too simple, need to match the complex LiveSheet structure
3. **Refine category mapping** - Especially for LDZ which is massively over-aggregated
4. **Create final processing script** - With correct logic to match all target values
5. **Generate final output file** - That exactly replicates the target structure

### üìÅ Key Files Ready
- `bloomberg_raw_data.csv` - Raw Bloomberg data (pulled from GitHub)
- `analysis_results.json` - Target values and column mappings
- `process_raw_data_to_target.py` - Basic processing script (needs refinement)
- `analyze_target_structure_detailed.py` - Detailed analysis script (ready to run)
- `2025-08-12 - European Gas Supply and Demand Balances LiveSheet (1.8.0).xlsx` - Target file

### üéØ Target Values to Match
```
France: 92.57
Belgium: 41.06  
Italy: 151.47 (critical - this was the original scaling issue)
Netherlands: 90.49
GB: 97.74
Austria: -9.31
Germany: 205.04
Total: 767.69
Industrial: 268.26
LDZ: 325.29
Gas-to-Power: 174.14
```

### üîß Technical Notes
- Raw data shape: (3241, 430) from 2016-10-01 to 2025-08-15
- Normalization factors loaded: 435 factors from use4.xlsx
- Target header row: 10, data starts row 11
- Column mappings identified and saved in analysis_results.json

**Ready to continue exactly where we left off!**
